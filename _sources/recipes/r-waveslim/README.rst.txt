Basic wavelet routines for time series (1D), image (2D)  and array (3D) analysis.  The code provided here is based on wavelet methodology developed in Percival and Walden (2000); Gencay, Selcuk and Whitcher (2001); the dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) from Kingsbury (1999, 2001) as implemented by Selesnick; and Hilbert wavelet pairs (Selesnick 2001, 2002).  All figures in chapters 4-7 of GSW (2001) are reproducible using this  package and R code available at the book website(s) below.
